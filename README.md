## Our Mission
MAPPING the ROUTE to grateful living

## The Team
* Janet Mensah
* Thomas Loughran
* Annie Wilson
* Hezekiah Adeusi

## The Project's Aims:
### For Users:
* To provide our users with a space to log their gratitudes, hardships and goals for the future.
### For Developers:
* To build on our working knowledge and skills of the React framework/library through implementation and utilisation of forms and React libraries such as React Pro Sidebar and React Icon, and more.

### How to use the Website:
* Download our app (coming soon!)
* Fork this repo and clone locally to your terminal.
* Run the API and the client project file locally.
* If you're a new user, create an account by inputting your name and email (password TBC)
* If you're an existing user, just click on the sign in button and input your details.
* Once you're signed in, you should be able to create a new journal entry, view all your entries and also edit or delete any entry in the list.
* Once you've finished logging all of your day (or week...or year!)'s happenings, remember to sign out!

## MVP
* Ability for user to sign in or create account
* Ability for user to create a new journal entry
* Ability for user to view, edit or delete all journal entries
* Ability for user to sign out

## Extensions
* Beautiful CSS
* Enabling password matching function (not encryption) when user signs in or creates account with name, email and password
* Mobile friendly botton that has a scroll function following the user as they navigate the page, so they can create a new journal entry from anywhere on the app
